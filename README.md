# IPL Case Study - Python Test Cases

Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with Python test cases for analyzing IPL (Indian Premier League) data. The notebook implements various test cases to validate data processing and analysis functions. The test cases check the accuracy, consistency, and performance of different IPL-related computations.

Features

1. Data Ingestion: Reads IPL match data from CSV or database.

2. Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides insights through statistical summaries and visualizations.

4. Function Implementation: Includes various functions to compute player performance, team statistics, and match outcomes.

5. Unit Testing: Ensures correctness and efficiency of implemented functions using test cases.

6. Visualization: Generates graphs and charts for better data interpretation (if applicable).

Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need the following dependencies:

1. Python 3.x

2. Jupyter Notebook

3. Pandas (for data manipulation)

4. NumPy (for numerical computations)

5. Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization, if included)

6. pytest (for running unit tests)

7. You can install the required libraries using:

8. pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn pytest

# How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook IPL_CaseStudy.ipynb

Execute the cells sequentially to load data, process information, and run test cases.

Running Tests

To run all test cases using pytest, navigate to the test directory and execute:

cd tests
pytest

This will automatically detect and run all test functions in the test_functions.py file.
